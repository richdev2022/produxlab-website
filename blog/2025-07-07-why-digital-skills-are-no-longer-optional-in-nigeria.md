**Why Digital Skills Are No Longer Optional in Nigeria**\
By Sunday Itodo

In today's world, digital skills are more than just a nice-to-have — they’re a survival skill.

From ordering food to applying for jobs, almost everything now happens online. Yet, a large number of young Nigerians still don’t have access to structured digital education. That’s a gap we must close — and that’s exactly what we’re doing at our **Digital Agency & Training Hub in Lokoja**.

#### The Reality

Nigeria has one of the **fastest-growing youth populations** in the world. But unemployment remains high because traditional jobs are limited. The global economy, however, is still **hiring — online**. From remote design roles to freelancing, e-commerce, and digital marketing, there are opportunities everywhere for those who have the skills.

#### The Digital Skills We Teach:

* **Website Design & Development**
* **UI/UX Design for Web & Mobile**
* **Graphic Design & Branding**
* **Microsoft Office Suite**
* **Product Strategy & Documentation**
* **Business-Centered Tech Services**

#### Why Our Hub Matters

We're not just training people — we’re creating a pipeline of young professionals who can **earn online, build businesses**, and offer digital services to local SMEs.

We also work directly with small businesses in Lokoja to help them **get online, look professional**, and attract customers in a digital-first world.

#### What Makes Us Different?

* We teach hands-on, not theory.
* We combine **training** with **real-world service delivery**.
* We are affordable and community-focused.
* We're powered by **local passion and global standards**.

#### Final Thoughts

Digital skills are the new oil. Every Nigerian youth deserves a chance to learn and earn with their knowledge. Whether you’re a business owner or someone looking to start a tech career — our doors are open.
