**Empowering Lokoja Through Digital Skills & Services**\
By Sunday Itodo

Lokoja, the capital of Kogi State, is full of potential — especially among its young people and small business owners. Yet, many are still disconnected from the digital world that powers today’s economy. That’s the gap I’m working to close through the launch of my **Digital Agency and Training Hub**.

My name is **Sunday Itodo**, and I’m a Digital Product Designer and Product Manager. After years of freelancing online, I’ve seen first-hand how tech skills and digital services can change lives. That’s why I’ve taken the bold step to return to Lokoja and establish a center that combines **professional digital services** with **practical tech education**.

#### What We Do:

* **Digital Services:** We provide businesses with UI/UX design, website design and development, branding, and digital strategy to help them thrive online.
* **Training Programs:** We offer training in Microsoft Office, Website Design, UI/UX, Product Strategy, and Graphic Design — equipping individuals with real-world skills.
* **Community Focus:** Our mission is to raise a generation of creators, freelancers, and entrepreneurs who can compete globally from right here in Lokoja.

#### Why This Matters

Many talented people in Lokoja lack access to structured learning, mentorship, or even the tools to get started in tech. Our hub bridges that gap by offering **affordable training**, a **creative working space**, and the kind of digital support local businesses need to grow.

#### Join the Movement

We believe that digital literacy is a right, not a luxury. Whether you're a business owner looking to grow your online presence, or a youth eager to break into tech, our doors are open.
